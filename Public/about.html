        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi there and thanks for taking the time to read a bit more about me!</p>
        <p>I'm a creative and curious soul who thrives on finding thoughtful solutions to problems, whether it's through troubleshooting, strategy, or design. I pride myself on being hardworking and dependable, I always manage to find my way through any challengeâ€”usually with determination, a few mini meltdowns, and a healthy dose of humor.</p>
        <p>I try to approach all things in life with a positive mindset - I believe that, even in the roughest of situations, we can find some positive if we try hard enough. With that being said, I am an extremely family oriented person! My family means the world to me; the ones I was born with and the family I am creating.</p>
        <p>I'm a passionate animal lover; cats especially hold a very special place in my heart (if you're a fellow cat person, you get it. If you're not, feel free to <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a>, we already have some things to work on!)</p>
        <p>I am hardworking by nature, but I also believe that being kind, collaborative, and grounded goes a long way.</p><p>Whether I am brainstorming new ideas, navigating a tricky challenge, or just enjoying the company of loved ones (furry or otherwise), I bring a mix of creativity, care, and commitment to everything I do.</p>
